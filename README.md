# Fruits
This project was a coding test interview in my last job

The Fruit project is divided in 4 projects
  - API
  - App (MVC Application)
  - Business
  - Data
  - (In some days a want to add the next project, Tests)


The software working flow is easy, just a simple CRUD.
It wouldn't need all this projects to do a simple CRUD like this, really, but here I want to show how to separete your application in modules (or layers).
Hope you enjoy!
